# Basic Usage

## Introduction

This project serves as an example of how to use the Taple SDK. We will deploy a *Bootstrap Node* in a PC and then connect to it with our mobile and create a subject and an event for it to check that it is working correctly.

## Repositories and tools

- Taple-sdk-android [https://github.com/opencanarias/taple-sdk-android](https://github.com/opencanarias/taple-sdk-android)
- Android Studio or a physical device
- An HTTP client like Curl
- Docker

## *Bootstrap Node*

The *Bootstrap Node* will need to be hosted on a machine that is network accessible for our phone (a WiFi LAN network, for example). This node will serve the purpose of hosting the Governance and acting as a meeting point for different phones. We need to run the *Bootstrap Node* before running the app because, for configuring the app, we will need parameters from the node.

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 50000:50000 \
-e TAPLE_ID_PRIVATE_KEY=f78e9b42c3f265d0c5bf613f47bf4fb8fa3f18b3b38dd4e90ca7eed497e3394a \
-e TAPLE_HTTP=true \
-e TAPLE_NETWORK_LISTEN_ADDR=/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/50000 \
-e RUST_LOG=info \
opencanarias/taple-client
```

Once our node is initialized, we need to create a Governance for our mobile node to connect to.

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:3000/api/event-requests' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "request": {
        "Create": {
            "governance_id": "",
            "schema_id": "governance",
            "namespace": "",
            "name": "MyGovernance"
        }
    }
}'
```

We need the *Governance ID* to continue. To get the current *Governance ID* we can execute the next petition to the API and get the ID from the response. We will need this ID further in the tutorial.

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:3000/api/subjects'
```

With the retrieved *Governance ID* from the previous step, we can use it to update our Governance and add a schema to it. This schema will allow us to create new subjects in our mobile node and check the events that our subject will create in our mobile node.

> Is important that you change the *subject_id* in the body os the request for the *Governance ID* that we previously obtained.

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:3000/api/event-requests' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "request": {
        "Fact": {
            "subject_id": "[HERE GOES YOUR GOVERNANCE ID]",
            "payload": {

                                "who": "ALL",
                                "schema": {
                                    "ID": "test"
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}'
```

Once we send petition to update the governance we need the *approval-request* ID of this petition to approve it. 

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:3000/api/approval-requests?status=Pending'
```

When we got this ID we can approve it replacing in the url the last part with the petition ID.

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:3000/api/approval-requests/[HERE GOES YOUR APPROVAL REQUEST ID]' \
--request PATCH \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"state": "RespondedAccepted"}'
```

If we execute again the `curl --location 'http://localhost:3000/api/subjects'` we should be able to see that our *Governance* is now updated and with the configuration that we specified before.

## Mobile Demo

First, we need the `TapleSDK` *.aar* to our mobile project. We can achieve this by downloading it from the releases or building it ourselves, as shown in the main `README.md` of the project. Once we have this, we should put it inside the `libs` folder. Depending on whether you compile the library or download it, you may need to adjust its name in the `build.gradle.kts` file.

We need to configure the app for the current *Bootstrap Node* and Governance configuration. To do this, we will modify the `Config.kt` that is in this project.

Once we configure it, we can compile the app running the Gradle script called `gradlew assembleRelease`. This script will generate an APK inside `app/build/outputs/apk/release`. We need to install this APK in an emulator or on a physical device.

When we have the app installed, we can launch it and follow the next steps to verify Taple:

1. Start the taple node and, very importantly, wait a couple of seconds to update the Governance in the mobile
2. Once we got the updated Governance we can create a subject and check it in the *Bootstrap Node* with the `getGovernances` petition previously used
3. Once the subject is created, we can create an event for this subject and check it the same way as before

You are done running a basic example with Taple. You can go to [www.taple.es](www.taple.es) to see more information about the technology and use cases in which it can be useful !
