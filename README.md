# TAPLE Sdk Android

TAPLE (pronounced T+üçé ['tap…ôl]) stands for Tracking (Autonomous) of Provenance and Lifecycle Events. TAPLE is a permissioned DLT solution for traceability of assets and processes. It is:

- **Scalable**: Scaling to a sufficient level for traceability use cases.
- **Light**: Designed to support resource constrained devices.
- **Flexible**: Have a flexible and adaptable cryptographic scheme mechanism for a multitude of scenarios.
- **Energy-efficient**: Rust powered, TAPLE is sustainable and efficient from the point of view of energy consumption.

This repository includes:

- Scripts for cross-compiling TAPLE FFI for Android 64-bit architectures.
- Kotlin library for using TAPLE FFI on Android. Includes an implementation of the TAPLE database interface using the Android SQLite libraries.
- Examples of use of the library

## Build

Building the library is optional. The library is distributed through [Github releases](https://github.com/opencanarias/taple-sdk-android/releases).

### Requirements
- Cross compilation
  - Rust. Minimium supported rust versi√≥n (MSRV) is 1.67
  - [Cross](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross)  
- Java 17 or higher
- Android development tools
  - Android SDK. The path to the SDK must be correctly configured using [environment variables](https://developer.android.com/tools/variables) or [local.properties](https://developer.android.com/build#properties-files) file.
  - Kotlin
  - Gradle
  - Android Studio (optional)

### Download
Clone TAPLE FFI and TAPLE SDK Android. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/opencanarias/taple-ffi
git clone https://github.com/opencanarias/taple-sdk-android
```

### Cross compilation
Cross-compilation generates the TAPLE FFI library for the different supported architectures and the bindings for Kotlin. Check the [FFI repository](https://github.com/opencanarias/taple-ffi) in case you need to install additional dependencies. 

```bash
cd taple-sdk-android/scripts
./setup.sh
./start.sh
```
The resulting artifacts are automatically copied to their corresponding location in the sdk folder.

### Lib generation

```bash
cd ../sdk
./gradlew assemble
```
Once the process is finished, the resulting libraries will be available at *./TapleSDK/build/outputs/aar*.

## Use
Explore the [examples](./examples/) folder to learn how to use TAPLE in your Android applications.

## Current limitations
Mobile devices do not usually have a public IP address, which prevents another TAPLE node from making a direct P2P connection with them. This means that currently only use cases where the mobile device initiates the connection with other TAPLE nodes can be addressed. 

In the future TAPLE will be able to solve this problem by using Push Nodes and/or Hole Punching techniques.
